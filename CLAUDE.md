# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a "suica-game-ai" project - an AI-developed game. The repository is currently in its initial state with only a basic README file.

## Current State

The repository contains:
- README.md with basic project description
- No build system or package configuration files yet
- No source code files present
- Clean git status on main branch

## Development Setup

Since this is a new project with no existing build system:
- No package.json, requirements.txt, or other dependency files exist yet
- No build, test, or lint commands are configured
- The project structure and technology stack are yet to be determined

## Next Steps for Development

When adding code to this repository:
1. Determine the appropriate technology stack based on the game requirements
2. Set up the appropriate build system (package.json for Node.js, requirements.txt for Python, etc.)
3. Establish project structure and architecture
4. Configure linting and testing tools as appropriate for the chosen stack
